# Neural_Network-Pattern_Recognition
Using a database("trainingDataset") of inputs and associated outputs, the program looks for patterns in the numbers with a range from 0 to 1. Once it finds a pattern to the best of it ability, by inserting an input("predictionSet") the program will be able to predict the output associated with the inserted input. It may be a output that the program has not seen before.
